# Intro to R for Data Science

This is an introductory course on the **Uplimit** platform.

I have become increasingly curious about R, and I have decided to enroll in this short course. 

We were introduced to core concepts in R, and shown powerful applications for its use in data analysis and visualization. 
Along the way we have been working on projects that are fun, interactive, and personalized to cement our learning.
